# Requirements
## Introduction

    - This project aims to build a converter that converts one form of data to to other form. For example- binary to gray, binary to decimal, gray to decimal and vice-versa.
 

## Research

    - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/conversion-of-gray-code-to-binary, learnt some comcepts from here. 


## Cost and Features

    - Features
        Available form of data as input - decimal form, binary form and gray format
        Output form - Other two form except input

## Defining Our System

    - Take the data in from the user in one of the form and convert it into other two forms and display the data.
